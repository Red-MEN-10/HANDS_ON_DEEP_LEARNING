# HANDS_ON_DEEP_LEARNING
This repository contains the practical application of  different types of NEURAL NETWORK.Starting from Artificial Neural NETS to RNN's and CNN's.The codes are mostly done to show how to practically train a neural network through python language using TENSORFLOW library.The codes here reflect me starting footsteps in the DEEP LEARNING journey and hence some models will not have great accuracy score the the sole purpose of this repository is to get myself exposed to the coding implementation of the whole DEEP LEARNING domain!!
