# Neural Network from Scratch: Unraveling Deep Learning Mechanics

This project showcases a neural network meticulously built from the ground up, reflecting a profound commitment to understanding *how* and *why* deep learning models function, rather than merely *that* they work. It's a hands-on exploration of core principles, from matrix operations to backpropagation.

The model is trained on the WHO dataset, specifically leveraging critical inputs like **Body Mass Index (BMI)** and **Total Government Expenditure on Health (% of GDP)** to predict **Life Expectancy**, demonstrating robust data handling and feature integration.

I will drop some useful links that helped me to visualize and develop this NEURAL NET from scratch
